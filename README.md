# Small-Misc
Several miscellaneous small projects: tests, algorithmic exercises etc...

# HoneyComb Walk
  The goal of this algorithmic exercise is to count the number of possible path
made by a bee with a given number of steps. The "naive" version simply used
recursion to simulate every possible path. The current version uses Memoization
to reduce the number of recursive calls.


# Pizza
  The goal of this exercise is to find the best place to start a pizza business
based on the number of pizza sold per blocks. The current version is still the
naive one, in which we calcultate the "value" of each square of the map, before
choosing the smallest result.
